use resampledWFB2_FFT with ESP32. See the README to make sure it works properly.
resampledWFB2 and resampledWFB are fairly similar

5/15
work off of WFB2: this one actually works properly

resampledWFB2: works
resampledWFBAvonly: works

resampledWFB2_FFT: the one were testing to see if FFT works while reading resampled data
*likely cause: memory issue

resampledWFB2: just regular wfb - works
