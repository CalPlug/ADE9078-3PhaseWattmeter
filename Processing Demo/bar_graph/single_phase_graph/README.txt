single_phase_graph_test.ino simulates FFT data. Use this to test the single_phase_graph.

You'll need to plug into an arduino to use the test.ino file.

if you get stuck, just google it. Processing has a lot of cool built in functions that will make your life easier.

If you can get single_phase to work then try to implement your design changes into the complete bar graph.
